# Questions


Try using a `TreeMap` and a `HashMap` instead of `MyHashMap`.
        1. Are the resulting word frequencies any different?

 - No, the frequencies are not different.

        1. Is the time performance any different? If so, how would you rank the three implementations (in increasing order of time complexity)?
        
 - The three implementations would rank Hash, myHash, Tree.

How are `%` and `Math.floorMod` different? Which works more reliably for computing a hash table index?

 - Math.floorMod will not return a negative number, whereas the modulo operation can. floorMod works more reliably for table indecies because negative numbers would go out of bounds.

What is the time complexity of `MyHashMap.size()`, and how could you make it much more efficient?

 - This.

How does this implementation compare to one where you would directly use your linked `Node` class from the earlier assignment? Answer briefly in terms of ease of implementation, correctness, reliability, and performance.

 - This.
